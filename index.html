	<h1>Hi!</h1>
	<p>After work I tinker with physics simulations and implementations of machine learning algorithms as I learn them, sometimes I finish them and they end up here. Occaisionally I go outside as well but you won't find that here. You could see these projects as an extension of my resume and skillset, but more importantly they are just the kinds of things I have fun working on.  </p>
